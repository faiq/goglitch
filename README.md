#Goglitch - a CLI for making glitch art

##Introduction:

Goglitch is suppsoed to be a simple cli for manipulating images, it's heavily inspired by the [glitcher libary](https://github.com/revisitors/glitcher). It is currently a work in progress but I plan on implementing most if not all of the functions in glitcher.
